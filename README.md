## Setting up your Build Environment 

Note: it's simpler to work with repos if you have your ssh key setup.

Choose or make a directory for your local repos.

I recomend ~/Documents/Projects

Clone the folowing repos to your machine:

https://github.com/opencoca/lt2d_school

https://github.com/opencoca/lt2d_school_admin

https://github.com/opencoca/simpleweb

https://github.com/opencoca/startr
